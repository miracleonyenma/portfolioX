The `Array.prototype.map()` runs a function for each element in an array and returns the value of the function into a new array.

It's just like a loop that creates a new array based on the function passed to it.

Let's say we have an array of _weebs_ which is basically an array of objects. Each having the following property names:  `name`, `honorific`, `likes` and `dislikes`.

```javascript
let weebs = [
    {
        name: "Uchechukwu",
        honorific : "Kun",
        likes: "Woman",
        dislikes: "School"
    },
    {
        name: "Fredrick",
        honorific : "Kun",
        likes: {"Mobile Legends","Yn@sh"},
        dislikes: {"Milk power","DENSE MC"}
    },
    {
        name: "Shori",
        honorific : "San",
        likes: "Devil may cry",
        dislikes: "Small money"
    },
];

```

We can create a new array called `weeb_names` from our current `weeb` array which will contain the names of our *weebs* and their honorifics.

```javascript
let weeb_names = weebs.map(weeb => {
    return `${weeb.name} ${weeb.honoriffic}`
})
```

Here, we map through our `weebs` array using `weebs.map()` where we pass an arrow function as an argument to our `map()` method and `weeb` as an argument to our arrow function.

`weeb` now represents each item in our array. Since each item in our array are objects, we can access their properties.

We then return a string of our weeb name and honorific using template literals to our new `weeb_names` array.

We access the `name` and `honorific` of each object in our original `weebs` array through the function argument  `weeb` which now holds the value of each object in our original array

Let's look at our new array of weebs
