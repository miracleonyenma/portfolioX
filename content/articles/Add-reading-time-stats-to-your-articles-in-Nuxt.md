Many blogs and publications today have a way to tell how how many minutes it may take to read a particular article, mostly by displaying the average reading time at the beginning of the post.

This information is pretty useful, it tells the reader how long it might take to read through the article and gives an idea of how rich the content of the article might be, depending on the title.

We'll be adding this feature to our Nuxt blog built with the [nuxt/content module](https://content.nuxtjs.org/) using the [reading-time](https://github.com/ngryman/reading-time) package.

## Prerequisites

For this tutorial, I'll assume that you've already set up your Nuxt project aFnd already have the nuxt/content module installed and set up.
If you don't, and want to follow along, you can check out this article on [creating a blog with Nuxt and Nuxt Content](https://nuxtjs.org/blog/creating-blog-with-nuxt-content).

Alright, let's dive right in.

## Install reading-time

The `reading-time` package helps you generate an estimate of how long an article will take to read. We just need to pass it our text, `HTML` or `markdown` content.

Navigate to your project folder and run:

```bash
npm install reading-time
```

## Create a hook to generate reading time for each article

Now that we've installed  the `reading-time` package, we need a way to get out text content from our articles and pas the to `reading-time` to generate an estimate number in `milliseconds` of our article reading time.

We'll use a hook provided for us from `nuxt/content`,  which is [`content:file:beforeParse`](https://content.nuxtjs.org/advanced/#contentfilebeforeparse) which basically allows you to modify the contents of a file before it is handled by the parsers.

So, in our `nuxt.config.js` file we'll add the following lines of code:

```javascript
...

  hooks: {
    'content:file:beforeInsert': (document) => {
      if (document.extension === ".md") {
        const stats = require('reading-time')(document.text)
        document.readingStats = stats
      }
    }
  },

...
```

Here, we checked to see if the extension of the file is `.md` so it only applies to our `markdown` files.
Then, we accessed the `reading-time` package using the `const readingTime = require('reading-time')` statement.

The `readingTime` function takes an argument, which is our article text that we want to generate the reading time from. Nuxt Content generates the `document.text` property for us which is the body content of a markdown file before it is transformed to `JSON AST` that we see in our Nuxt app that it uses to render the content.

So, we pass `document.text` to `readingTime` which returns an object of values that looks like this:

```javascript
// ->
// stats: {
//   text: '1 min read',
//   minutes: 1,
//   time: 60000,
//   words: 200
// }
```

We assign this object to `stats` and then add it to our document using `document.readingStats = stats`.

Now, If we run:

```bash
npm run build
```

and if we check our devtools, we should see `readingStats` as part of our content object

Awesome!

## Displaying reading time in the UI

If you've set up your blog, depending on how you fetch article data in your `_slug.vue` you probably already have access to the `readingStats` object.

For me, I have something like this in my `<sript>` in `_slug.vue`

```javascript
...

export default {
  async asyncData({ $content, params }) {
    const article = await $content('articles', params.slug).fetch()
...
```

`article` is now available in my component and I can render my `readingStats` object in my template like so:

``` html
<span> {{article.readingStats.text}} </span>
```

and that should display the value on render.

## Conclusion

Notice I used `readingStats.text`, it displays the reading time in text e.g. `"4 min read"`
There are other values you can use to achieve a higher level of customization.
