The best way Iâ€™ve tried to do this on my Linux machine is with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

## What's NVM

`nvm` allows you to quickly install and use different versions of Node via the command line.
You can read more about it and how to install it on the [README](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#readme).
`nvm` was originally developed for Linux systems, however it can be installed separately for Windows.

## Install on Linux

To install on Linux run:

```bash
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash

    #or
    wget -q0- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash
```

Then close and reopen the terminal for the system to recognize the changes or run the command:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Install on Windows

`nvm` can be installed on the windows system using the following steps:

1. Go to this [site](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases)
2. Install and unzip the `nvm-setup.zip` file

## Install on MacOS

No hard feelings Mac users, just jejely follow the instructions [here to install nvm with homebrew](https://tecadmin.net/install-nvm-macos-with-homebrew/).

To verify that it was successful, run:

```bash
nvm --version
```

Great!
Now, youâ€™re ready to rumble.

You can do a lot with `nvm` here are some examples:

```bash
$ nvm use 16
Now using node v16.9.1 (npm v7.21.1)

$ node -v
v16.9.1

$ nvm use 14
Now using node v14.18.0 (npm v6.14.15)

$ node -v
v14.18.0

$ nvm install 12
Now using node v12.22.6 (npm v6.14.5)

$ node -v
v12.22.6
```

Simple as that!

## Install and use the LTS version of Node

This is recommended for most users. To do this run:

```bash
nvm install --lts
```

<img-cont src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_C4CE6587E02352D1AC34B3EB0768C873811C626FE830907FA5F5AAACB7A92A3C_1648024445485_image.png" alt="Output of nvm --install in terminal" style="zoom:100%;"></img-cont>

Hermoso âœ¨, now you can go and install that stubborn package.

## Make the new version default

Now, if you close your current terminal and run `node -v` you might notice that it still shows your old node version.

You can try to set a the new version as default:

```bash
nvm alias default v16.14.2
```

Close your terminal and open again to run `node -v` again to check. You should see the new version.

## Make sure to exit open terminals that still show old Node versions

If youâ€™re using VSCodeâ€™s terminal for example, you might notice that even if you close the terminal by clicking on the trash can icon, when you open it again, and run `node -v`, it still shows you the old node version.

Youâ€™ll have to exit the terminal by running:

```bash
exit
```

When you open it again and check the terminal, you should see the new node version.
